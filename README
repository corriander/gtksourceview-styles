These are a set of color styles gathered and slightly adjusted or fixed over time by myself. I am not their creator, but I deemed it useful to have them all together in a repo along with the modifications I usually want on them.
To make use of them in GEdit (or other editors that make use of the gtksourceview-2.0 component), just issue the following commands in a shell and restart your editor:

# 1. Purge old files (just to make sure).

# for Gnome 2.x
$ rm -rf ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/styles

# for Gnome 3.x
$ rm -rf ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/styles

# 2. Clone styles in-place.

# for Gnome 2.x
$ git clone http://github.com/valeriupalos/gtksourceview-styles.git ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/styles

# for Gnome 3.x
$ git clone http://github.com/valeriupalos/gtksourceview-styles.git ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/styles

The license and copyright for the styles is written in each file respectively. Enjoy!
