These are a set of color styles gathered and slightly adjusted over time by me. I am not their creator, but I deemed it useful to have them all together in a repo.
To make use of them in GEdit (or other editors that make use of the gtksourceview-2.0 component), just issue the following commands in a shell and restart your editor:

$ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/styles
$ git clone \
	https://valeriupalos@github.com/valeriupalos/gtksourceview2-styles.git/ \ 
	~/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/styles

The license and copyright for the styles is written in each file respectively.
