These are a set of color styles gathered and slightly adjusted over time by me. I am not their creator, but I deemed it useful to have them all together in a repo.
To make use of them in GEdit (or other editors that make use of the gtksourceview-2.0 component), just issue the following commands in a shell and restart your editor:

# Purge old files (just tp make sure).
$ rm -rf ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/styles

# Clone styles in-place.
$ git clone git@github.com:valeriupalos/gtksourceview2-styles.git ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/styles

The license and copyright for the styles is written in each file respectively.
